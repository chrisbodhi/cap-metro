# CapMetrocket
## WebSocket implementation of CapMetro's realtime service tracker

## Development

- Ensure you have `node` v8.9+ and `npm` installed.
- Clone repo.
- Run `npm install`.
- To start the server locally on port 8080, run `npm start` from the project root.
- To test the WebSocket call, open `example-index.html` in your browser. You should see data related to the 7 and 10 bus lines in your browser window and browser console.
- Visit [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) for more information about the service.
- Tests are written with [Ava](https://github.com/ava/ava). Before adding unit tests, make sure you aren't just exercising module code or third-party libraries.
- Committing will run a series of checks before completing including linting & tests.

### Deploying

- Get your changes into the `master` branch. NB: the branch is protected, so no force-pushing.
- Log into Heroku from the command line: `heroku login`.
- Deploy with `git push heroku master`.
- Inspect the server response with `heroku logs --tail`.

## ðŸšŒ  RoadmapÂ ðŸšŒ

- [x] Socket connection serving static JSON: [branch](https://github.com/chrisbodhi/cap-metrocket/tree/implement-ws)
- [x] Call to CapMetro for current data: [branch](https://github.com/chrisbodhi/cap-metrocket/tree/get-live-data)
- [x] Repeat call to CapMetro every x seconds, sending fresh data to client: [branch](https://github.com/chrisbodhi/cap-metrocket/tree/call-cap-metro)
- [x] Add Express server for getting query params + responding to static HTTP requests: [branch](https://github.com/chrisbodhi/cap-metrocket/tree/add-express-server)
- [x] Filter data returned by route number. [branch](https://github.com/chrisbodhi/cap-metrocket/tree/filter-response)
- [ ] Deploy to server on Heroku.

## Working with the Service


For the 7 and 10 bus lines, and 550 train line when it's not running.

_Abbreviated Client Code_

```
const conn = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080?routes=7,10,550");
conn.onmessage = (evt) => {
    console.log(JSON.parse(evt.data));
}
```
